			Developer experience - our daily experience when trying to get the job done. All of that
			should be efficient, sustainable and joyful.
			<br />
			<br />
			Happy developers build better software!
			<br /><br />
			The myriad of tools that are released each single day initially sounded like the promised developer-land.
			While choice is great, it doesn't necessarily make our lives easier. How does that feel?

		There is light at the end of the tunnel.
		<br />
		<br />
		Individual developers, teams and projects start to think deeply about design, style and taste for
		tools to help us get into a flow focused on what we all love most: being creative and writing elegant
		code.
		<br />
		<br />
		What all of them have in common is the desire to delight, the desire to reduce friction, and the
		desire to leverage automation to create a Swiss clockwork that works reliably below the surface.
		<br />
		<br />
		This community is for them.
