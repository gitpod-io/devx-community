			<br />
			<h4 class="font-bold text-important">Transfer of Data to Third Parties</h4>
			<p>
				We will transfer your personal data to a third party only (i) within the scope of legal
				provisions, i.e. if we are obliged to transfer the data due to a government or court order,
				or, (ii) if applicable, legal provisions authorize the transfer, e.g. if the transfer is
				required to pursue our legitimate interests or to fulfil a contract, for example in case of
				mergers and acquisitions, (iii) or if you give your explicit consent.
				<br /><br />
				For more information please refer to this privacy policy or contact us via
				<a href="mailto:data@gitpod.io">data@gitpod.io</a>.
			</p>
			<h4 class="font-bold text-important">Automated Decision Making including Profiling</h4>
			<p>
				In general we do not process any personal data via automated decision making including
				profiling via the Website or Service. However, such profiling or automated decision making
				may happen by third party providers through the Website or Service. We will inform you about
				such fact if possible.
				<br /> <br />
				Profiling means any automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects
				relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects relating to the performance
				of work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour,
				location or relocation of that natural person. Examples of such profiling include the analysis
				of data (e.g. based on statistical methods) with the aim of displaying personalized advertising
				to the user or (for example) giving shopping tips. The data subject shall not be subject to a
				decision based exclusively on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal effect
				against them or significantly affects them in a similar manner.

				<li>
					to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data, if e.g. the accuracy
